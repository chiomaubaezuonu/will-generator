                <p>
                    Writing a Will is critically important for all adults regardless of wealth, marital status, or age. A Will allows you to: ensure that your possessions will be distributed as you wish; appoint and outline powers of an executor and/or trustee; appoint a guardian for minor children; specify funeral wishes; expedite the legal process; and reduce stress and heartache for loved ones. See the DYOW Blog or Why Do I Need a Will page of this site for more information.

                <h2>What happens after signing my Will?</h2>
                <p>
                    After signing the Will:
                    Decide where the original Will is to be kept and inform the executor of the location. and deliver it (getting a receipt). Beware of storage in a bank safety deposit box as some states require that they be sealed upon death and retrieval of the Will documents could be difficult. Generally, storage in a fireproof box or some other safe location should be sufficient.

                    Be sure to let the executor and any alternates know the location of the Will. Remember that, should you desire to change your Will in the future, a formal Codicil or new Will will have to be executed. You should not write on or otherwise attempt to revise the Will.

                    Remember: Periodically review changes in your life and consider whether you should change your Will.
