            <p className='card-text'>Writing a Will is critically important for all adults regardless of wealth, marital status, or age. A Will <br /> allows you to: ensure that your possessions will be distributed as you wish; appoint and outline powers <br /> of an executor and/or trustee; appoint a guardian for minor children; specify funeral wishes; expedite <br /> the legal process; and reduce stress and heartache for loved ones.</p>

            <p className='text-[#2f323a] text-lg font-bold'>What happens after signing my Will</p>
            <p className='card-text'> After signing the Will:
                Decide where the original Will is to be kept and inform the executor of the location. and deliver it (getting a receipt). Beware of storage in a bank safety deposit box as some states require that they be sealed upon death and retrieval of the Will documents could be difficult. Generally, storage in a fireproof box or some other safe location should be sufficient.</p>
                <br />
            <p>Be sure to let the executor and any alternates know the location of the Will. Remember that, should you desire to change your Will in the future, a formal Codicil or new Will will have to be executed. You should not write on or otherwise attempt to revise the Will.</p>
